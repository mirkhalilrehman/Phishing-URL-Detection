Phishing URL Detection with Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to detect phishing URLs using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes features extracted from URLs, such as lengths, counts of special characters, and presence of certain patterns. The project utilizes multiple classifiers and fine-tunes them to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, it features a Streamlit web application that allows users to test URLs in real-time and receive predictions on whether they are phishing attempts or legitimate.
